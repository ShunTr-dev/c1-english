# The past: habitual events and specific incidents 
## Narrative tenses: describing specific incidents in the past

 This *happened* when I *was* about five years old. My father *had gone away* on business for a few days and my brother and I *were sleeping* in my parents' bedroom. Before we *went* to bed that night, I *had been reading* a very scary story about a wicked witch. In the middle of the night, I *woke up* with a start and *saw* that a figure in a dark coat *was standing* in the doorway. I *screamed* at the top of my voice.


When we describe specific incidents in the past, we use *narrative tenses*, i.e. the past simple, past continuous, and past perfect simple or continuous
    - We use the past simple to talk about the *main actions in a story* (We went to bed. .., I woke up. I screamed). 
    - We use the past continuous to *set the scene* (We were sleeping in my parents' bedroom) and to describe actions in progress in the past (Somebody was standing in the doorway). 
    - We use the past perfect and the past perfect continuous to *talk about the earlier past*, i.e. things which happened before the main event (My father had gone away.... I had been reading a story).

## *used to* and *would*: describing habitual events and repeated actions in the past

 1. Every summer, my family *used to rent* an old house in the south of France. My sister and I *often walked* to the harbour in the morning, where we *used to watch* the fishermen cleaning their nets.
 2. Every night before we went to bed, my mother *would tell* US stories, but she *would never read* them from a book - she *would always make them up* herself.
 3. When I was a teenager, my friends *were always teasing* me because of my red hair.


1. We often use `used to + infinitive` as an alternative to the past simple to talk about things that we *did repeatedly* in the past. 
   - We can also `use used to + infinitive` to talk about situations or states which have changed, e.g. I used to have much longer hair when I was younger.

2. We use `would + infinitive` as an alternative to used to to talk about things that we did repeatedly in the past over a period of time. 
   - We *don't* use would with stative verbs, i.e. to talk about situations or states which have changed. NOT I-would-have-much-longer-hair- when-I-was-younger.
   - We *don't* use would without a time reference, e.g. I used to play the violin. NOT I-would-play-the violin. 

3. We can also use `always + past` continuous for things that happened repeatedly, especially when they were irritating habits.


`used to and be / get used to` Be careful not to confuse `used to and be / get used to`. used to only describes states or repeated actions in the past, be / get used to means be fget familiar with, e.g We used to live in London. We moved to the country last year, but we re still not used to it It's too quret for me, and my husband can't get used to having to driveÂ everywhere.
